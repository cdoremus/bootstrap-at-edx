# bootstrap-at-edx repository
Holds code from Bootstrap 3 course at edX

The *examples* folder holds the examples that was hand-coded by me from the course videos. I enhanced the examples to provide a reference repository for use later.

The *lab* folder holds the code from course graded exercises. I received a perfect score for all of these exercises.

The *resources* folder holds the Bootstrap 3.3.5 and jQuery 2.1.4 files used by code in the examples and lab folder.
