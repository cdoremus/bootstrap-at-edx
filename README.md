# bootstrap-at-edx repository
Holds code from Bootstrap 3 course at edX

The *examples* folder holds the examples that was hand-coded by me from the course videos. I enhanced the examples to provide a reference repository for use later.

The *lab* folder holds the code from course graded exercises. I received a perfect score for all of these exercises.

The *resources* folder holds the Bootstrap 3.3.5 and jQuery 2.1.4 files used by code in the examples and lab folder.

The index.html file in this folder holds links to the course work.
It can be browsed from the file system.

To deploy this code to a local web server, see comments in the Dockerfile for instructions on how to build and serv the code in nginx using Docker.
